# RealTimeSpeechSynthesis
A project which seeks to hear the unheard, this program reverse transforms electrical impulses from an advanced bionics cochlear implant and turns it into real sound.

Based Around the STM32F746ZG Nucleo Board, this utilizes ADC, DAC, internal timer, GPIO, and DMA peripherals to very quickly transform data from biphasal amplidinal waveforms into audio. It does this by a version of a RFFT.
